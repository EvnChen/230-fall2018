# Project 3: Create an "IGM Student Survival Guide" Website 

## Description
Working as part of a group, you'll design and implement a website with tips and tricks for IGM students. You'll have deliverables for each of the stages we discussed in week 3: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.  

## Deliverables

### Strategy and Scope (Submit to myCourses by 8am Sat 3/25)
Your group should write and submit a document in which you describe the goal of the site (what specific problem or user need will you be addressing?), as well as the type of content that you intend to include. You should also work as a group to determine who will have responsibility for various aspects of the project--who will be responsible for the documentation, the written content on the site, the wireframing, the visual design, the coding? Once you've determined individual responsibilities, each person should update their own section of the group's roles & responsibilities document to include that information. 

### Structure (Bring to class Thursday 3/30; submit to myCourses by 11:59pm)
Create an inventory list of content that you'll include on your site--what's already out there than you can use? What will you need to create yourselves? Generate an information architecture (*not interaction flow*) diagram showing how that content on your site will be grouped and organized. We'll do a brief critique in class before you turn this in at the end of the day. Both the list and the diagram should be included in a single PDF document that you submit to myCourses. It should also be added to the "designdocs" folder in your GitHub repo. 

### Skeleton (Bring to class Thursday 4/6; submit to myCourses dropbox by 11:59pm)
Create wireframes for each of your major page types (e.g. main/landing page, main category page, individual content page, about page), showing the basic grid and page layout you plan to use. We'll do a brief critique in class, and your group can start on design mockups and code once that's done. All of the wireframes should be added to a single PDF document that you upload to myCourses and GitHub. 

### Surface (Bring to class Thursday 4/13; submit to myCourses dropbox by 11:59pm)
Create mockups in Photoshop or another graphics program showing your intended design for the site. There should be one mockup for each wireframe you created. Once again, we'll do a brief critique in class before you turn them in to myCourses. Include all of the mockups in a single PDF document that you upload to myCourses and GitHub.

### Final Site (Posted on Github and on people.rit.edu by 8am Wednesday, 4/19)
All files for the site must be posted to your shared GitHub repository. In addition, at least one group member has to publish the site to people.rit.edu. Everyone in the group must link from their igme230 page to the final project--you can link to one shared copy, or to your own copy. (If you want to use the site as a portfolio piece, you should make sure you publish your own copy.) Once the site is complete, each person should update their section of the roles & responsibilities document and describe what their actual contributions to the project were. 

## Page and Content Requirements
- Landing page named index.html
- Global navigation bar
- At least three categories of information, with at least three content pages in each
- About page containing the following:
  - Information about your team members (names and photos)
  - Contact form using mailto: action (you can create a throwaway email account for this if you want)
  - Source information for any images, content, or code that you didn't create yourself (including CSS frameworks, typefaces, and any code libraries)
  - If you used a CSS framework, explain if/how you modified its default appearance settings 
  - What you did to go beyond the base expectations for the project--what did you do that was particularly challenging? This could involve art/design, content, or code. 

## Design Requirements
- Responsive design with a minimum of two layouts--one optimized for desktop, one for mobile
- If a CSS framework is used, colors and typefaces must be modified so that the site is not a "cookie cutter" replica of the framework's templates
- Principles of visual design (taught in prerequisite classes) employed: clear visual hierarchy, good use of white space, effective alignment of content, thoughtful choices of colors and visual elements
- Effective typography employed; typeface(s) chosen should be clear and legible as well as appropriate to the content being presented

## Technology Requirements
- Semantic, valid HTML
- Well-structured, valid CSS
- Passes WAVE accessibility evaluation without significant errors 
- Semantic HTML
- Navigation menu available on all pages; can be pure CSS or CSS+JS 
- Images and other media are properly optimized for screen display
- Contact form uses Javascript to validate input; no blank fields, and valid format for sender's email address

## Grading
Component | Percentage of Project Grade |
--------- | --------------------------- |
Strategy & Scope Document | 5% |
Structure Document & Diagram | 10% |
Skeleton Wireframes | 10% |
Surface | 10% |
Individual Roles & Responsibilities Document | 25%  | 
Final Site | 40% |

Each of the first four deliverables will be graded as Excellent (100%), Good (85%), Poor (70%), or Missing (0%). 

The Individual Roles & Responsibilities document is in your group's Github repo. Each group member should add their responsibilities to the document at the start of the project, and write their own self-assessment when the project is turned in. You will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10; I will focus on the level of your participation with your group, the amount you contributed to the final project, and whether you completed the work that you committed to.  

The final site will be graded using the same basic rubric as for the personal porfolio project. Once again, to get the last four "above and beyond" points you'll need to exceed my expectations on least one aspect of your site--use of code, quality of design, depth of content, etc. 

Requirement | Possible Points (20) |
