    <h1>Project 1: Basic Personal Page</h1>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Update the index.html file for your igme230 GitHub repository to include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your name (and, optionally, the course name)</li>
        <li>a (recognizable) picture of yourself</li>
        <li>placeholders for links to your in-class exercises and class projects (keeping in mind that the list of exercises
            will have at least 20 items, and probably more, before the end of the semester).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(If for privacy reasons you do not want to make your name or photo public, please talk to me about setting up a pseudonymous
        page.)</p>
    <p>Do your best to use the principles of design you learned in IGME-110 or other design classes; I want to see the best
        you can do. (That does not mean putting in every type of bell and whistle you can imagine; keep it simple and clean!)
        This is your opportunity to make a good first impression :)</p>
    <p>Remember to design <em>for your audience</em>–which in this case is me. I’ll be using this page throughout the semester
        for two tasks: associating your face with your name, and reviewing the work you do in this class. Keep in mind that
        while sometimes I’ll be viewing your work on a high-res 15.6&quot; ASUS laptop running Chrome on Win 10, I’ll also
        often be using my 9.7&quot; iPad Pro with mobile Safari, or my 12&quot; MacBook. To ensure that your page works in
        all of these environments, I recommend testing in a 1024x768 screen layout.</p>
    <p>Your page should use standards-compliant HTML for structure and CSS for both design. It should be entirely your own
        work–while it is fine to take design inspiration from other websites, you must write your own HTML and CSS for this
        assignment. (In other projects, you will have the opportunity to work with existing frameworks and/or templates of
        code.)</p>
    <p>All of your CSS should be commented, with an explanation as to what the style is accomplishing, so that I know you
        understand the code you’re using. Here’s an example:</p>

    <pre><code>
        /* This puts my photo on the right side of the page, 
        adds a thin black border to the image, 
        and leaves 15px of space between the text and the image. */

        #portrait {
            float: right;
            padding: 0px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            margin-left: 15px;
            }
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
    <p>The completed page is due at midnight (11:59pm) on Friday, September 14th. The page should appear properly at the
        URL specified in the requirements by that time. You do not need to send me email or post anything to myCourses.</p>
    <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
    <p>I will use this rubric for grading your pages:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr class="header">
                <th>Requirement</th>
                <th>Possible Points</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr class="odd">
                <td>Located at specified URL</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="even">
                <td>Recognizable photo and name</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="odd">
                <td>Placeholders for exercise and project links</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="even">
                <td>Uses valid HTML &amp; CSS</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="odd">
                <td>CSS used for formatting and layout</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="even">
                <td>CSS annotated</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="odd">
                <td>Demonstrates understanding of design principles</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2 id="privacy-issues">Privacy Issues</h2>
    <p>Occasionally there are reasons that a student doesn’t want their name and image visible on the open web. If this is
        the case for you, please let me know and I’ll provide you with instructions for an alternative publishing option
        that will be password-protected.</p>
