    <h2 id="week0">Week 0 (Before class begins): <br class="mobile-break">HTML and CSS Prereq Review</h2>
    <div class="weekly_content">
        <p>All students in this class are expected to have familiarity with basic HTML and CSS. I will not be reviewing basic concepts in this class, so if it’s been a while since you’ve taken a class that covers it (IGME-110 for NMID students, NMDE-103 for NMD students), you may need to get yourself up to speed before we begin. I recommend either of these tutorials:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html?org=rit.edu">Lynda.com HTML Essential Training</a>, sections 1-7 (requires RIT login)</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>On the Saturday after classes begin (September 1), I will offer an optional HTML/CSS/FTP “bootcamp” that you are welcome to attend if you’d like some extra help getting back up to speed on the concepts. Details will be provided in the class Slack.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="week1">Week 1 (Aug 29/31): <br class="mobile-break">Course Overview / Web Publishing</h2>
    <div class="weekly_content">
        <p>On Tuesday, I will review the syllabus, goals, and requirements for class, and discuss the tools and technologies we’ll be using for communication, collaboration, and content creation. On Thursday, we’ll talk about how web servers process the requests they receive from browsers, and how you can use .htaccess files to modify that behavior. We’ll also discuss hosting options, both at and outside of RIT.</p>

    <h2 id="week-5-sep-2628-responsive-design-css-media-queries"><a name="week5">Week 5</a> (Sep 26/28): Responsive Design &amp; CSS Media Queries</h2>
    <p>Mobile devices now make up more than half of the traffic to major websites. And it’s still the case that people regularly print out web pages for a variety of reasons. That means web designers need to make sure their pages work on a variety of screens, and in print format–not just on high-resolution computer monitors. The process of creating HTML and CSS that will adapt to a variety of devices is called responsive design. CSS Media Queries allow responsive design to work more effectively by determining how/where the page will be displayed.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tuesday Readings</strong> On Tuesday we’ll start looking at using CSS to create different versions of a page for different media types.

    </ul></li>
    <li><p><strong><a href="./weekly_materials/week5/responsiveExercise.md">Thursday Exercise</a></strong> - In this exercise, you’ll create two sets of styles for a web page–one optimized for full-size browsers, and the other optimized for mobile.</p></li>

    <p>On Tuesday, we’ll talk about complex CSS selectors, and will cover the basics of creating and styling HTML forms (which you’ll need when we start coding with JavaScript). On Thursday, we’ll look at CSS Flexbox, a better CSS-based approach to creating flexible, responsive page layouts.</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Note: While <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">browser support for Flexbox</a> is pretty well established at this point, it’s still necessary to use <a href="http://shouldiprefix.com/">browser prefixes</a> if you need your page to work reliably in older browsers.</p>

    <p>Many responsive websites are built using pre-existing frameworks of CSS and JavaScript that enable the developer to focus on content and design rather than the underlying code necessary for responsive functionality.</p>
    <p>Tuesday is a reading day, so we will not have class that day. I will be available for one-on-one meetings to provide feedback on your portfolio projects.</p>

    <p>While this course focuses primarily on front-end web development, almost all modern web development depends on server-side functionality as well. In some cases, that functionality is custom-designed and built–but in many other cases, it’s provided by standard software packages that run on the server, like WordPress or Drupal. We’ll also discuss the variety of hosting options available for web pages and applications.</p>
