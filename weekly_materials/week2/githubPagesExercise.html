  <h1 id="week-2-github-pages-exercise">Week 2 GitHub Pages Exercise</h1>
  <p>As discussed in lecture, GitHub provides the ability to publish a basic website from a repository. In this exercise,
    you’ll learn how to create a website associated with your GitHub username, as well as how to create one associated with
    a specific project/repository.</p>
  <h2 id="creating-a-personal-github-site">Creating a Personal GitHub Site</h2>
  <p>(If you already have a personal github site, you can skip this.)</p>
  <p>You can create a site for a user or organization by creating a new repository in that account with the name <em>username</em>.github.io;
    this will automatically be used to serve web pages from that address.</p>
  <p>You can see an example at https://github.com/mamamusings/mamamusings.github.io (my personal GitHub pages repo) and http://mamamusings.github.io
    (the resulting website).</p>
  <p>In your GitHub account, create a public repository called <em>username</em>.github.io</p>
  <p>Clone the new repository to your computer using VS Code, and create an index.html file that includes your name and an
    image. Use CSS to make it look moderately professional. Commit and push your files to GitHub, and use a web browser to
    go to <em>username</em>.github.io–your files should show up there!</p>
  <h2 id="creating-a-project-based-github-site">Creating a Project-Based GitHub Site</h2>
  <p>You’ll be publishing all of your work for this class using GitHub pages. Rather than placing this in your personal directory,
    you’ll create a new repository specifically for coursework.</p>
  <p>Create a new repository called igme230 in your account. Clone it to your computer using VS Code, create a simple index.html
    file, and push that file to GitHub. However, because it’s not in the <em>username</em>.github.io directory, it won’t
    immediately be available on GitHub Pages.</p>
  <p>On the GitHub site, select “Settings” for the igme230 repo, and scroll down to the GitHub Pages settings. Choose master
    branch as your source, and save. (Do not try to install a Theme; these do not use standard HTML, but instead use a templating
    language based on Ruby; if you want to explore using Jekyll for GitHub Pages, you can find documentation here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-jekyll-themes-on-github/)</p>
  <p>Your project website should now be visible at <em>username</em>.github.io/week14project</p>
  <h2 id="deliverables-for-today">Deliverables for Today</h2>
  <p>Add a link to your main class page for your personal GitHub Pages site, and your week14project site.</p>
  <h2 id="when-youre-done">When You’re Done…</h2>
  <p>I doubt this will take the full class period for you to complete. Use the remaining time to work on either the practice
    practical, or project 4.</p>
