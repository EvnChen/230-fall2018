# Week 1 Tuesday Exercise (29 August 2017)

## Overview & Goals

We're going to use some class time today to get you set up with the communication tools we'll be using this semester. I'll only be using myCourses for grades--all content will be distributed via this Github repository, and while I'll respond to emails, you'll get faster responses (and help from your peers) if you use the Slack chat I've set up for the class. 

## Github

If you're reading this, you've figured out how to get to the class content on Github. Congratulations! 

Because these materials are in a public repository ("repo"), you don't need a Github account to access them. However, later in the semester you'll be learning how to use Git and Github to keep track of files in your own projects, so you'll need an account for that. 

Github accounts are free, but with a free account you can only have public repos, which means everybody can see all of your files. Since you'll be uploading files related to some of your assignments, private repos make more sense. Happily, Github offers a free "Student Development Pack" that gives you unlimited private repos. Because you need to verify your student status with Github in order to get this perk, I'm going to have you apply for that today. That way we can be sure you'll have a working account by the time you need to start putting your own files online in week 4.

Here's the page to sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join 

Once you have an account, go to the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) website. You can see a list there of all the perks you get--the most important one, and the only one you'll need for the class--is the unlimited private repos. 

Click on the link to get the pack. You'll need to fill out the form with your RIT email address, RIT's name, and your expected graduation date. For the "How do you plan to use GitHub?" question, you can say that you'll be using it for assignments in your web development courses. 

## Slack

I've created a Slack site for our class at [http://lawley230-fall2017.slack.com/](http://lawley230-fall2017.slack.com/). It's set up so anyone with an @rit.edu address can create an account, just to make things easier. (NOTE: Every Slack site uses its own login and password, so even if you already use Slack for another group, you'll need to create a new user ID and password for this one.)

Your user name should include your first name and either your last initial or your last name, like this:  lizlawley, liz_lawley, or lizl or liz_l. 

After you've successfully logged into Slack, post a brief message in the #introductions channel so I know you're there. 

## Using Visual Studio Code

The text editor I'll be using in class to demo HTML, CSS, and Javascript is Visual Studio Code. It's free and cross-platform, and supports all of the technologies we'll be using the class. To get the most out of it, however, you'll need to add some extensions. (If you prefer to use Brackets, that's fine--it has extensions to provide comparable functionality, but you'll need to find them yourself. You also may find that it doesn't work quite as well with GitHub, something that will be important later in the semester.)

After launching VS Code, choose Extensions from the View menu. These are the extensions that I find most useful for the kinds of work we'll be doing in this class, and I recommend you install them on your own computer. 

While you can install them in the lab, they need to be reinstalled every time you log in, so I'll let you know which extensions you need for specific in-class exercises. 

- Hasher
- HTML CSS Support
- HTMLHint
- htmltagwrap
- Replace Smart Characters

We'll also be talking in class about VS Code's built-in HTML tools (like Emmet), as well as the additional functionality that these extensions provide.
