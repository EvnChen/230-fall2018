                <li>.htaccess file properly installed in www/igme230 directory on banjo.rit.edu</li>
                <li>file includes mod_pagespeed override</li>

            <p><strong>Due Sunday 9/2 at noon</strong>. We will grade this exercise by going to people.rit.edu/<em>youruserid</em>/igme230 and checking to make sure that pagespeed is disabled and that a custom error page loads if we type in a nonexistent file name.</p>

                <p>In this exercise, you’ll be adding an .htaccess file to a directory on the banjo.rit.edu web server. The file will fix some troublesome default behavior on the banjo.rit.edu server, and will also allow you to use a custom 404 page for your site.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>RIT’s banjo/people web server uses a server module called “Pagespeed” to speed the loading of images–which is helpful when you have high-traffic websites like the main RIT page or departmental pages, but not really necessary for personal pages. The problem with this module is that it has the side effect of adding a lot of code to your pages when they’re returned to the browser, making it harder to debug and validate them.</p>

                <p>You can’t change the default server settings for banjo–only the system administrator can do that. But you can change the way the server handles files in your account, using a file called .htaccess. The instructions in that file will affect how the server processes all of the files in the directory you place it in, as well as all of the files contained in any subdirectories.</p>

                <p>The period at the beginning of the file name is intentional; it indicates a hidden file in UNIX. However, that same period can make the file difficult to work with on a personal computer–depending on how you have your operating system configured, you may not be able to see hidden files in the explorer/finder environment. However, VS Code has no problem creating or reading hidden files.</p>

                <p>Start by using FTP to retrieve a local copy of www directory on banjo. Use VS Code (or your preferred editor) to open the local copy of the directory. Create a new file in the www folder called .htaccess, and in that file, put these two lines of text. The first line is a comment (indicated by a # followed by a space), and the second turns off the Pagespeed module for this directory (and all of the directories inside it).</p>

                <pre><code>
 # Turn off server Pagespeed module
 ModPagespeed off
                </code></pre>

                <p><em>Note: if you already have an .htaccess file in your www directory, you can add that line to the file rather than creating a new file.</em></p>

                <p>Use an SFTP client (like FileZilla or MobaXterm) to upload the .htaccess file to your www folder on the banjo.rit.edu server.</p>

                <p>Make sure you set the permissions on this file to 644 (Read and Write for you, Read only for group and other). You can do this using the FTP client, or by logging in to the server using MobaXterm (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac) and running the appropriate chmod command.</p>

                <p>Try loading your main classwork page (people.rit.edu/<em>youruserid</em>/igme230) in a browser. If you get an error, it could be a mistake in the syntax of the file contents, or in the file permissions of the file or folder. Ask for help if necessary. Don't go on to the next section until it's working!</p>

                <h2 id="part2">Part 2: Creating a Custom 404 Page</h2>

                <p>Most professional websites have a custom 404 error page that displays if you try to go to a page that doesn’t exist on the site. That’s quite easy to set up using .htaccess.</p>

                <p>Create a new html document called custom404.html. You can put whatever you’d like in the page content--the only requirement is that it should include an image of some sort. (Here's <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/best-404-pages-812505">some inspiration</a>.) When it's done, upload it to your wwww directory on banjo.</p>

                <p>If you don't already have an igme230 directory in your www directory, create one now. Create a new .htaccess file in that directory. It will inherit the settings from the directory above it, so you don't need to add the pagespeed instruction--you'll only be using this file for the custom error page instruction. Here's what needs to go into the file (remember to replace <em>youruserid</em> with your <strong>own</strong> RIT ID!):</p>

                <pre><code>
 # Add custom 404 error page
 ErrorDocument 404 /youruserid/igme230/custom404.html
                    </code></pre>

                <p>Note that the path needs to be a complete path from the root of people.rit.edu down to the location of the custom error page--not a relative path.</p>

                <p>Upload the the two files to your igme230 directory on banjo. Make sure you set the permissions properly for the directory (755) and both files (644).</p>
                
                <p>Try going to a nonexistent page in your week3 directory–something like this: people.rit.edu/<em>youruserid</em>/igme230/nonsense.html. If you’ve done everything properly, you should see the nonsense.html URL you typed in the location bar, but the custom error page that should be displayed in the browser. If it doesn’t work, ask for help!</p>
