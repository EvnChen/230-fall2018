# Design Document Creation Exercise

## Overview & Goals
On Tuesday, you're going to begin work on a design document for your personal portfolio site. This should be written in a Word or Google docs document, brought to class on Thursday for critique, and submitted to the myCourses dropbox by the end of the weekend. 

## Document Components

### Strategy: User Needs & Site Objectives
Start by clearly defining who you anticipate will be using your site. Co-op employers? Full-time employers? Freelance job customers? People writing letters of recommendation? Based on that, what will your users expect to find, and what do you want them to find or do? Write a paragraph or two answering these questions. 

### Scope: Functional & Content Requirements
What functionality will your users expect? Should they be able to search the site? Fill out a contact form? View a gallery of your work? Play a game you've created? Download a PDF of your resume? Write this up, in as much detail as you can, and add it to the document. 

What content needs to be included to meet the needs listed in the strategy step? Make a list of all the content you expect to include in the site (including a list of individual pieces of work you've done that could or should be included), and add that to the document. 

### Structure: Information Architecture
It's unlikely this site will involve many branching interactions, so you don't need to do any interaction design flowcharts for this site. You should, however, create a flowchart showing what pages you expect to have on the site (the information architecture) using any of the tools discussed in Tuesday's lecture. Add the flowchart to your document. 

### Skeleton: Wireframe
Wireframes will show the general grid and organization of your pages. What will the home page contain, and how will it be laid out? What about the contact page? Individual content pages? Most of the wireframing tools discussed in Tuesday's lecture will allow you to export an image of the wireframe (or you can take a screenshot, or take a picture if it's hand-drawn). Add this to your document. 

### Surface: Mockups
Once all of the other components are complete, you can use those to start creating mockups for your site. Mockups should be done in Photoshop (or your preferred image editing, illustration, or page layout program). They should clearly show your initial visual design plan for the site, including color schemes and typography choices. 

## Uploading and Due Date
A draft of the document should be brought to class on Thursday, for critique by both your peers and the professor. A final version of the document must be submitted to the myCourses dropbox by midnight (11:59pm) on Sunday, September 24th.
