# Project 4 Prep Exercise 

## Overview & Goals
This week you'll be planning for your final project, both in terms of content and technology. 

## Step 1: Define Your Content and Functional Requirements
What are you going to make? Storyboard it, and think about what kind of functionality you'll need in order to implement it. 

## Step 2: Set Up Your GitHub Repo
Create a repo for your project, which will include a README.md file describing what you're going to do. If it's a private repo, make sure you add me as a collaborator. If you're working with a partner, you should share a single repo. 

## Step 3: What JavaScript Will You Need to Implement Your Idea?
What type of interaction do you need to implement? Which library or libraries will you need in order ot make it work? Look at the various libraries linked from the [project 4 resources page](../../projects/project4-resources.md) for ideas. Choose your library *after* you have a good idea about what kind of functionality you need. A

## Step 4: Complete Tutorials or Replicate Demos
Complete a tutorial or create some demo pages using the library that you think will work best for your project. But don't be surprised or disheartened if the first library you choose ends up not working as well for you as you would have liked. It's fine if you end up needing to use something different. 

## Step 5: This Week's Deliverable
Post at least one example of a new javascript library demo or completed tutorial to banjo for your exercise this week, no later than 11:59pm on Friday night, and link to it from your main class page. Include an explanation of what you chose and why (either on the example/demo/tutorial itself, or next to the link to it from your main class page).  

## Step 6: Finish Your Proposal
Write up your content and technology plan in your README.md document. If you want your final project grade to replace the grade for projects 1 and 2, make sure you indicate that in your document. This is due by Sunday, 11/19, at 11:59pm.
