# Print CSS Exercise 

## Overview & Goals
Today's exercise will take you through the process of modifying the CSS for a web page to allow it to print properly. 

## Setup
Download the [resume.zip](weekly_materials/week5/resume.zip) from the week5 folder, and unzip the contents. There will be a resume-example folder, with an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a folder with images. Rename the folder to week5, and put it in your igme230 directory.  

Modify the CSS for the page to allow for a print-friendly version. When you're done, you'll upload the week5 directory to your igme230 directory, and link to it from your main classwork page. Your version should be uploaded by 11:59pm tonight (Tuesday, 9/26).
