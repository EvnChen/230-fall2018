# Print CSS Exercise 

## Overview & Goals
Today's exercise will take you through the process of modifying the CSS for a web page to allow it to print properly. 

## Setup
Download the [resume.zip](resume.zip) file and unzip the contents. There will be a resume-example folder, with an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a folder with images. Rename the folder to week5, and put it in your igme230 directory.  

## Changes
Modify the CSS for the page to allow for a print-friendly version. Make your own choices about what you think will work well--in general, you don't want light text on a dark background (assume the user has "print background graphics" enabled in their browser),  you don't want things that have to be clicked on (like menu links) or typed into a contact form, and you don't want a fixed header that appears on every page. 

The only part of the HTML you are allowed to edit is the connect section, and you may only *add* content to the HTML, not remove anything. 

When you're done, upload the week5 directory to your igme230 directory, and link to it from your main classwork page. Your version should be uploaded by 11:59pm tomorrow (Wednesday, 9/27)
