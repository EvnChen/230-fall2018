## <a name="week1">Week 1</a> (Aug 29/31): Overview: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
On Tuesday, I will review the syllabus, goals, and requirements for class, and discuss the tools and technologies we'll be using for communication, collaboration, and content creation. On Thursday, I'll talk about some general HTML and CSS concepts, and we'll start on an HTML & CSS exercise that builds on the content you should have covered in previous classes. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Course Syllabus](README.md)
  - [Slack Guides: Getting Started for New Users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users)
  - [Chrome DevTools Overview](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week1/toolsExercise.md)**
  - In this exercise, you'll set up your GitHub account, set up an account on the class Slack, and configure either Visual Studio Code or Brackets for use in class. 

- **Thursday Readings**
   - Review the content in [Lynda.com HTML Essential Training, Lessons 1-3, 6, and 7](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html?org=rit.edu). Some of it should be familiar (like basic HTML structure and markup). Other parts may be new (like structuring content with semantic tags, linking to regions inside a page, and creating complex lists). To speed things up, you can skim the transcripts for new concepts, rather than watching all of the videos, and just watch the portions you need to get caught up. 
 
- **[Thursday Exercise](./weekly_materials/week1/basicMarkupExercise.md)**
  - We will begin the process of marking up a text file with HTML and CSS  

## <a name="week2">Week 2</a> (Sep 5/7): CSS
This week we'll take a deeper dive into aspects of CSS that aren't covered in the prereq classes: the CSS box model, CSS element positioning, CSS selector types, and using Google fonts.

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Lynda.com HTML Essential Training, Lessons 4-5](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html?org=rit.edu). 
  - [Lynda.com: Learning CSS, Sections 1-3](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Fundamentals/417645-2.html?org=rit.edu): This is a video-only tutorial, rather than a hands-on tutorial, so it will take less time to complete. Some of it will be review from past classes, but it goes into significantly more detail that the prerequisite classes. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](./weekly_materials/week2/advancedMarkupExercise.md)**
  - We will revisit the file we worked on last week, adding additional CSS formatting.
 
- **Thursday Readings**
  - [Lynda.com: CSS Box Model, Sections 1-3](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Making-Sense-CSS-Box-Model/372544-2.html?org=rit.edu)

## <a name="week3">Week 3</a> (Sep 12/14): Web Server Basics & Version Control 
This week we'll talk about how web servers process the requests they receive from browsers, and how you can use .htaccess files to modify that behavior. We'll also talk about version control for websites, and you'll be introduced to Git and GitHub for tracking and maintaining files for your website(s). I highly recommend starting on Thursday's GitHub tutorials *early*, as they'll take some time to work through. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [.htaccess-Guide](http://www.htaccess-guide.com/)
  - [Comprehensive guide to .htaccess](http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml)

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week3/github-exercise.pdf)**
  - In this exercise, you'll work with two different GitHub repositories to learn how to submit a pull request to a repository controlled by someone else, and how to collaboratively edit a file with other users. 

## <a name="week4">Week 4</a> (Sep 19/21): Designing for the Web
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web. On Tuesday we'll focus on the design process as a whole.

## <a name="week5">Week 5</a> (Sep 26/28): Responsive Design & CSS Media Queries
Mobile devices now make up more than half of the traffic to major websites. And it's still the case that people regularly print out web pages for a variety of reasons. That means web designers need to make sure their pages work on a variety of screens, and in print format--not just on high-resolution computer monitors. The process of creating HTML and CSS that will adapt to a variety of devices is called responsive design. CSS Media Queries allow responsive design to work more effectively by determining how/where the page will be displayed. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
On Tuesday we'll start looking at using CSS to create different versions of a page for different media types.  
  - [Lynda.com CSS Fundamentals: Media Types & Queries](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Media-types-media-queries/417645/484795-4.html?org=rit.edu) - This was included in the CSS Fundamentals tutorial from week 2, but for review, you should look at the portion of that tutorial dealing with the topic.
  - [A Comprehensive Introduction to Grids in Web Design](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-comprehensive-introduction-to-grids-in-web-design--cms-26521) - A good overview of the importance of grids in web design. 
 
 - **[Tuesday Exercise](./weekly_materials/week5/cssPrintExercise.md)** - In this exercise, you'll create a print media query for a web-optimized resume. 

- **Thursday Readings**
On Thursday we'll dive more deeply into responsive design concepts.
  - [Lynda.com: Responsive Design Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Web-Responsive-Design-tutorials/Responsive-Design-Fundamentals/104969-2.html?org=rit.edu) - Like the "CSS Fundamentals" tutorial from week 2, this is not a hands-on tutorial--instead, it is an overview of what responsive design is, why it's important, and how it's typically implemented. In class, we'll have a hands-on exercise applying these concepts. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](./weekly_materials/week5/responsiveExercise.md)** - In this exercise, you'll create two sets of styles for a web page--one optimized for full-size browsers, and the other optimized for mobile. 

 
## <a name="week6">Week 6</a> (Oct 3/5): CSS Flexbox, Complex Selectors, and Styling HTML Forms
On Tuesday, we'll talk about complex CSS selectors, and will cover the basics of creating and styling HTML forms (which you'll need when we start coding with JavaScript). On Thursday, we'll look at CSS Flexbox, a better CSS-based approach to creating flexible, responsive page layouts.  

- **Tuesday Readings**
   - [MDN: The native form widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets)
  - [Google Developers: Build Amazing Forms](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/input/forms/)

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week6/formsExercise.md)**: You'll be creating and styling a complex HTML form. 

- **Thursday Readings**
Start with the MDN and CSS Tricks readings (they're not very long) so that you get a good sense of what FlexBox is and how it works. Then I *highly* recommend that you also do the Lynda.com tutorial so that you get some hands-on experience with flexbox-based layouts. Keep in mind that the tutorial was created four years ago; <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">browser support for Flexbox is much more established at this point</a>. However, it's still necessary to use <a href="http://shouldiprefix.com/">browser prefixes</a> if you need your page to work reliably in older browsers. 

  - [MDN: Using CSS Flexible Boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)
  - [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  - [Lynda.com: CSS Flexbox: First Look](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Flexbox-First-Look/116352-2.html?org=rit.edu)

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week6/flexboxExercise.md)**: In this exercise you'll be creating a simple flexbox-based version of the basic page layout you worked on in week 2. I will be out of town, but the TA will be avilable in our classroom to help with the exercise if you need it. 

## <a name="week7">Week 7</a> (Oct 12): Web Frameworks
Many responsive websites are built using pre-existing frameworks of CSS and JavaScript that enable the developer to focus on content and design rather than the underlying code necessary for responsive functionality.  

Tuesday is a reading day, so we will not have class that day. I will be available for one-on-one meetings to provide feedback on your portfolio projects. 

- **Thursday Readings**
  - [CSS Frameworks & Grids](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Frameworks-Grids-2016-Q3-REVISION/504266-2.html?org=rit.edu) - You don't need to do the exercises, just watch the videos. 
  - [About Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html) - This is the framework you'll be using for this week's exercise
 
- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week7/frameworkExercise.md)**: In this exercise you'll create a complex, responsive web page layout using a CSS Framework.


## <a name="week8">Week 8</a> (Oct 17/19): CSS Transitions, Animations, & Menus; Scalable Vector Graphics
On Tuesday, we'll look at how CSS can be used to create transitions, animations, and interactive menus. On Thursday, we'll talk about Scalable Vector Graphics on the web. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Lynda.com CSS:Animation](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Animation/439683-2.html?org=rit.edu)

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week8/cssAnimationExercise.md)**: You'll be applying what you learned in the CSS Animation tutorial to the framework-based page you created with Materialize. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week12/week12tuesday.md)**: Some basic practice with SVG graphics.


## <a name="week9">Week 9</a> (Oct 24/26): JavaScript for Web Interactivity
This week we'll start using JavaScript to implement interactivity in websites. On Tuesday we'll talk about underlying concepts, like the Document Object Model, and implement some basic JavaScript interactivity on a web page. On Thursday, we'll look at Event Listeners and Cookies. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [MDN: Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week9/jsBasicExercise.md)**: You'll be creating two web pages, one that uses JavaScript to modifies properties of elements on the page, and one that displays calculations based on user input. 

- **[Thursday Exercise 1](weekly_materials/week9/jsEventListenersExercise.md)**: You'll use some new JavaScript functions to create a currency calculator. 

- **[Thursday Exercise 2](weekly_materials/week9/jsCookiesExercise.md)**: You'll change page content and then save those changes to cookies so that they can be applied when the page is reloaded.     

## <a name="week10">Week 10</a> (Oct 31/Nov 2): JQuery & JQueryUI
A great deal of the Javascript on the web uses a freely-available library of code called JQuery (which, in fact, was originally written by an RIT student!). This week we'll look at JQuery and how to use it in your pages. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week10/jqueryExercise.md)**: You'll implement some basic jQuery functionality on a page. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week10/jqueryuiExercise.md)**: You'll use the jQuery UI library to extend jQuery's functionality and add UI enhancements to page. 

## <a name="week11">Week 11</a> (Nov 7/9): Web Applications I


## <a name="week12">Week 12</a> (Nov 14/16): Web Applications II


## <a name="week13">Week 13</a> (Nov 21): Web Accessibility
On Thursday we'll talk about accessibility for the web, and I'll have you do some accessibility assessments of web pages. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Web Accessibility Initiative: Diversity of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/diversity)
  - [Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines (WCAG) At-A-Glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/Overview)

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week13/accessibilityExercise.md)**: You'll assess several web pages for accessiblity problems. 

## <a name="week14">Week 14</a> (Nov 28/30): Web Content Management & Hosting Environments
While this course focuses primarily on front-end web development, almost all modern web development depends on server-side functionality as well. In some cases, that functionality is custom-designed and built--but in many other cases, it's provided by standard software packages that run on the server, like WordPress or Drupal. We'll also discuss the variety of hosting options available for web pages and applications. 

## <a name="week15">Week 15</a> (Dec 5/7): Server-Side Coding & Practical Exam
On Tuesday we'll talk about server-side authentication and simple server-side programming using PHP. On Thursday, you'll take the practical exam. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week15/phpAndAuthExercise.md)**: Basic PHP functions

- **[Optional Exercise](weekly_materials/week15/phpEmailExercise.md): Creating a Contact Form with a PHP Script**: I've created an *optional* exercise that teaches you how to make a working contact form for your site that generates an email message. This will not be graded, nor will it be on the practical exam, but it's a useful thing to know how to do. 

## <a name="finals">Finals Week</a>: Practical Exam Makeup & Final Project Due
If you fail the final practical exam in week 15 (with a score lower than 7/10), you will need to take the makeup version during our final exam time slot. 

Your [final individual project](projects/project4.md) will be due this week.
