## <a name="week4">Week 4</a> (Sep 19/21): Designing for the Web
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web, including Jesse James Garrett's excellent diagram showing the various elements of user experience. In class, I'll have you break into groups to look at and critique a number of websites.

## <a name="week5">Week 5</a> (Sep 26/28): Responsive Design & CSS Media Queries
Mobile devices now make up more than half of the traffic to major websites. And it's still the case that people regularly print out web pages for a variety of reasons. That means web designers need to make sure their pages work on a variety of screens, and in print format--not just on high-resolution computer monitors. The process of creating HTML and CSS that will adapt to a variety of devices is called responsive design. CSS Media Queries allow responsive design to work more effectively by determining how/where the page will be displayed. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
On Tuesday we'll look specifically at using CSS to create different versions of a page for different media types. This was covered in the CSS Fundamentals tutorial from week 2, but for review, you should look at the portion of that tutorial dealing with the topic. 
  - [Lynda.com CSS Fundamentals: Media Types & Queries](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Media-types-media-queries/417645/484795-4.html?org=rit.edu)

- **Tuesday Exercise**
Download the [resume.zip](weekly_materials/week5/resume.zip) from the week5 folder, and unzip the contents. There will be a resume-example folder, with an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a folder with images. Rename the folder to week5, and put it in your igme230 directory.  

In class, I'll walk through the file with you, discuss the way CSS is used to format the page, and show some modifications that I made to create a print-friendly version. Then you'll create your own print-friendly version. When you're done, you'll upload the week5 directory to your igme230 directory on Banjo. Your version should be uploaded by 11:59pm tonight (Tuesday, 2/21). 

- **Thursday Readings**
On Thursday we'll dive more deeply into responsive design concepts.
  - [Lynda.com: Responsive Design Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Web-Responsive-Design-tutorials/Responsive-Design-Fundamentals/104969-2.html?org=rit.edu) - Like the "CSS Fundamentals" tutorial from week 2, this is not a hands-on tutorial--instead, it is an overview of what responsive design is, why it's important, and how it's typically implemented. In class, we'll have a hands-on exercise applying these concepts. 

- **Thursday Exercise**: Bring a wireframe and mockup of your personal portfolio to class; you'll be broken up into small groups to critique each other's designs. 

- **[Thursday Homework](weekly_materials/week5/thursdayExercise.md)**: In this exercise you'll be adding CSS to a simple web page to create a basic responsive version. 
 
## <a name="week6">Week 6</a> (Oct 3/5): Advanced CSS Formatting: CSS Flexbox and Styling HTML Forms
On Tuesday, we'll look at CSS Flexbox, a relatively new approach to creating flexible, responsive page layouts. While it's only supported by recent browsers, it's starting to be more widely used in web design and development.  On Thursday, we'll cover the basics of HTML forms (which you'll be using when we start coding with JavaScript and PHP), and how to use CSS to style them for better usability. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
Choose **one** of the following: 
  - [MDN: Using CSS Flexible Boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)
  - [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

  - [Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines (WCAG) At-A-Glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/Overview)

- **[Thursday Exercise (Accessibility Writeup)](weekly_materials/week3/thursdayExercise.md)**


## <a name="week8">Week 8</a> (Oct 17/19): CSS Frameworks
Many responsive websites are built using a pre-existing framework of CSS (and often Javscript, as well) that enables the developer to focus on content and design rather than the underlying code necessary for responsive functionality. 

- **Week 8 Tutorials: Do *One* of These**
  - [Building a Responsive Portfolio Site](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Building-Responsive-Portfolio-Site/372808-2.html?org=rit.edu): A basic introduction to using a CSS framework (in this case, Skeleton) to create a responsive website.

  - [Bootstrap 3 Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Bootstrap-3-Essential-Training/417641-2.html?org=rit.edu): Even though Bootstrap is now up to version 4, this tutorial covers the basics of how Bootstrap works, and how you can use it to create responsive designs. If you decide to work with Bootstrap for your project, I recommend also completing [Bootstrap 4: First Look](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Bootstrap-4-First-Look/372547-2.html?org=rit.edu), which looks at the differences between Bootstrap 3 and 4.

## <a name="week9">Week 9</a> (Oct 24/26): CSS Animation & Transitions
Modern CSS can control more than just the static presentation of web pages; it can also be used to animate elements on the page. This week, we'll look at CSS animation and transition effects. 

On Thursday we'll talk about the group project, and then you'll split into groups to start planning your site. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Lynda.com CSS:Animation](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Animation/439683-2.html?org=rit.edu)

## <a name="week12">Week 12</a> (Nov 14/16): JQuery & JQueryUI
A great deal of the Javascript on the web uses a freely-available library of code called JQuery (which, in fact, was originally written by an RIT student!). This week we'll look at JQuery and how to use it in your pages. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week11/week11tuesday.md)**: You'll implement some basic jQuery functionality on a page. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week11/week11thursday.md)**: You'll use the jQuery UI library to extend jQuery's functionality and add UI enhancements to page. 


## <a name="week13">Week 13</a> (Nov 21): SVG for the Web
While most of the graphics we've worked with up until now have been images created in other programs, it's also possible to use markup languages to draw graphics on the screen. This week we'll look at how and why to use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week12/week12tuesday.md)**: Some basic practice with SVG graphics.
